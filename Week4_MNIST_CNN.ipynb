    "### Task 1:\n",
    "Design, implement and test a neural network utilising a single convolutional layer (use as many other non convolutional layers as you need) to classify the MNIST handwritten digits. What is the maximum test accuracry you can achieve using a single convolutional layer?\n",

    "### Task 2:\n",
    "Design, implement and test a neural network utitlising multiple convolutional layers (again use as many other non convolutinal laters as you need) to classify the MNIST handwritten digits. What is the maximum test accuracry you can achieve using as many convolutional layers as you like?\n",

    "You should use this notebook for your work and upload it to both Moodle and CoCalc. You are expected to use TensorFlow and Keras to complete these takss. The notebook should be self-contained and able to be executed if necessary. Marks will be awarded for (roughly equally weighted):\n",
    "- Overall notebook clarity (both in terms of good coding practice and coherent discussion)\n",
    "- Network performance (how well does your classifier do?)\n",
    "- Network efficiency (how does your network compare to the optimum networks for this task?)\n",
    "- Network training (do you do a good job of traning your network?)\n"
